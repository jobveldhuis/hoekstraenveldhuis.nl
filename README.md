This repository contains the public source code of the website of Hoekstra & Veldhuis B.V., which has been [licensed](https://github.com/jobveldhuis/hoekstraenveldhuis.nl/blob/main/LICENSE) using the BSD 3-Clause license.

We originally built our website in Webflow, then transferred to this repository in plain HTML. It has been a work in progress for over a year. Many ideas have crossed our minds since, including a WordPress theme and a Jekyll website. In the end, we have decided to go with NextJS for its flexibility and performance.

## Get started quickly
1. Git clone into the project
2. Copy `.env` and rename the copied file to `.env.local`
3. Set environment variables according to your needs
4. Run `yarn dev` to start the application locally

## Building and deploying to production
All deployments are automatic and will be performed by Vercel on merge to the `main` branch. In any other branch, you will be given a preview deployment after pushing to your branch.

## Contributing
This project is currently not open to contributors, as it is being maintained and actively used by Hoekstra & Veldhuis B.V.
