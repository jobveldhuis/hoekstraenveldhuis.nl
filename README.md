# hoekstraenveldhuis.nl
This repo contains the public source code for the Hoekstra & Veldhuis B.V. website that was originally built in WordPress. This is an active repo from which deployments to the live environment are done.

We are currently working on a NextJS app of these HTML template files. The progress can be found on the [next-step-forward](https://github.com/jobveldhuis/hoekstraenveldhuis.nl/tree/next-step-forward) branch.

## No license?
As of may 2020, the conscious decision has been made to make this an unlicensed repo. The contents of this repo, including the website, belong to Hoekstra & Veldhuis. Because we believe in making things available to the public, no matter how small, we have decided to publish its source code. Feel free to get inspired by our website, but we kindly request you do not copy it 1:1.

## Future plans?
Our website was originally built in Webflow (yeah, I know). After this, we decided to port our Webflow export to a Bootstrap-powered HTML website. In the future, we will be transferring this HTML template into a WordPress theme. The original HTML files will then be moved to a new branch.

## Currently in use?
No, we are still working on the HTML port of the original Webflow files.
